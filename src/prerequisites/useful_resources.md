## Rust
This guide assumes that you already have some knowledge of basic Rust. We recommend reading chapters 1-9 of the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) which cover the basics of using Rust (Most of the time you don't need advanced Rust to write anchor programs).

## Solana

The next chapter explains some of the basic concepts required to make it through this book. That said, our intro chapter currently only briefly covers the basics, so we also recommend checking out the official [Solana developers page](https://solana.com/developers).
